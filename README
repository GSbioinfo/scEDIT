## Introduction

CRISPR Cas9 system has been revolutionizing the gene therapy research and paving the way for personalized medicine. Although CRISPR can silence/correct/modify the gene with greater precision compared to other nuclease off-target and impreseaice activity remains a major safety concern. Bulk DNA sequencing provides a population level view of the CRISPR however details of rare and large deletions are diluted. Single cell DNA-seq Tapestri platform provides a tool to study the CRISPR activity at single cell resolution. Currently, analysis of Tapestri generated can only be done using the custom Tapestri bioinformatics pipeline with restricted availability. scEDIT is lightweight and portable software tool for analysis of CRISPR editing at single cell resolution. 
scEDIT starts with raw sequence data from Tapestry library, extracts and identifies cell barcode and amplicon count in each cell. Furthermore, scEDIT detects and identifies CRISPR induced small indels as well as large deletions.    

## Features

 Main features of scEDIT:

- Processing of raw sequence data (Only other alternative is Tapestri Bioinformatics Pipeline with restricted access).   
- Extraction of cell barcode and generation of amplicon count matrix
- Detection and identification indels and large deletions
- Identifies zygosities of CRISPR-induced mutations
- Lightweight and portable can be run efficiently on inexpensive desktop with multicore/threaded CPU (AMD/Intel) 
- Easy to install and use with conda environment
- Also include tool for separating reads by cell barcode and Amplicon ID for deeper downstream analysis

### Prerequisites

List any prerequisites, for example:

- Python 3.9
- Dependencies src/.yml

### Installation Steps
Download the folder with all the 
Create conda environment using the file src/.yml

### Implementation (run in scEDIT conda environment)
 
$ipython /full-directory-path/scEDIT_TapRipper_Wrapper.py /full-directory-path/SampleSheet.xlsx /full-directory-path/output-dir

Above command generates bash scripts in the /full-directory-path/output-dir for each sample in the SampleSheet (Example SampleSheet and Amplicon sheets are provided in scCRISPR_suppFiles)

Run each bash_(*SAMPLEID).sh file using following command
$sh bash_(*SAMPLEID).sh


Final fastq files are stored in /SubjectID/SampleName/result_out/fastqs/
Reads did not qualify the criteria are stored in dump fastq files stored in /SubjectID/SampleName/result_out/fastqs/

Final counts and edit details files stored in /SubjectID/SampleName/result_out/final_count/
final_count folder also contains plots showing cell rank and barcode count. 

###Single cell CRISPR data analyzed using scEDIT is from work of Elisa ten Hacken et al published in Genome Biology
